I first download all the files and copyt my code from last project to it, and read through symtab.cpp and symtab.hpp to understand how they work.

Then I started to implement check_for_one_main(), and it made me understand deeper about the whole picture. 

Next I just went over the typecheck.cpp to implement functions one by one, since some are hard, I skipped them and do the easier ones first. I had difficulty with the function call, and left it to the last implementation.

In order to debug, since there are a lot of issues regarding Basetype, I added functions that can print out the basetype. So I can do things like 

	cout << p->m_expr->m_attribute.basetype() << endl;

to check where the problem is. I also print out the name of the node that is visited so I can see how the tree is traversed from the terminal. I used this method to debug for a long time and fixed all my issues.

I also went over the instrtuction's error type one by one to see if there is any missing in the implementation. After that I checked issues about scope, and there didn't seem to have a problem.

Last I comment out all the cout statements so that it can build a ast.
